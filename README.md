single-cell analysis tutorial
=============================

This project shows a basic approach to analyse single-cell RNA-sequencing data. 
We included the comparison of different dimension reduction techniques and pseudotemporal ordering of the data using *diffusion pseudotime*.
 
We provide the tutorial as *iPython Notebook*: If you use the *jupyter* software, you may download the *ipynb* file directly and run the tutorial on your local machine. In addition, there is the plain R file of the tutorial that contains all commands displayed in the iPython notebook.
